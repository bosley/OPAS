# Demo Apps

Alice, Bob, and Jim work together to demonstrate the nexus library

Start alice, and start bob. They will be sending direct messages to eachother. 
After a moment, they will register with one-another and then also send broadcast data to one-another. 

Then, start Jim. Jim will register with Alice and begin receiving Alice's broadcast data too!

After 30 seconds Bob and Alice will synchronize with eachother and Jim will start receiving Bob's broadcasts in-addition
to Alice's
