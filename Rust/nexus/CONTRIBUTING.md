# Contributing to Nexus

:sparkler: Thank you for considering adding a contribution to Nexus! :sparkler:

## What should I know before I get started?

While this project is small, it is best to maintain some sort of standards to ensure that we don't turn Nexus into a pile of spaghetti.
To help prevent that from happening every issue / feature should have its own branch created with a branch name that is clear and concise.
Every branch created should be rebased onto master, with its commits squashed prior to submitting a pull request. Why? Because it makes it
easier. 

### Branch names

[ Bug-fix | Feature | Optimization | Wiki ] - [Description]

***Example:*** _Optimization-CPU-usage-in-network-handling_

### Comments and Documentation

Everything done _MUST_ be thoughtfully commented and, if exposed to a library user, be well documented by the auto documentation that
***cargo doc** generates. The coolest features, and most important bug fixes will be denied if this is ignored. :wink:

## Where can I find something to do ?

On the Dark Carbon page there are project boards for each DC project. Features and Optimizations that are proposed can be found there. 
Issues (Bug-fix) can be found in the Nexus repo's project board under the _Nexus-Issue-Tracking_ board. If there isn't anything there, 
and you think of a nifty feature, or find an aweful bug, please add it to the repo issue tab and it will be discussed before either 
plopping it onto a project board, or directly pulling in the branch that you decided to go ahead and create. 

### Conclusion 

Realistically, anything done with some sort of thought behind it that can be clearly defined will be considered and most-likely added.
