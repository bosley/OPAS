### About

Dark Carbon (DC) is a project with the aim of making it easy to build reliable and secure communication networks. There are a myriad of applications being created today where developers spend a great deal of time building and securing communications for remote control, monitoring sensors, or streaming data. Right now there are frameworks that exist for this purpose, but what will set DC apart from others (_hopefully_) is modularity and ease of use.

### Message Forwarding

To ensure mobile nodes within the network maintain communication with each other there will be a need to forward messages through relay nodes. DC will facilitate relaying messages by nodes designated to do so. Relay nodes don't necessarily need to be used for this specific case, they could be used in stationary networks as well. It will be up to the user to define what relays are used for.
