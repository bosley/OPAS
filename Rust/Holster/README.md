# Holster

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bosley/Holster.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/bosley/Holster)

This relatively straight forward library to store types into the same container by serializing the data and shoving it into a *Holster*.
The Holster item its self can contain any item that implements the 'Holstable' trait.

# Examples

For examples, check the examples directory. It shows how to use the basic types that have an implementation built into the library, as well as how to use the trait on structs so you can stuff anything into a holster.
