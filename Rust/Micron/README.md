The Micron (*uM*) language is a small toy language being used to help me explore rust and language creation. The Micron language uses [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) along with [rug](https://gitlab.com/tspiteri/rug) to do the heavy lifting of language operations. It all started with me wanting to play with [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) and then it seemed obvious that [rug](https://gitlab.com/tspiteri/rug) was the only good way to handle numbers. With [rug](https://gitlab.com/tspiteri/rug) we can do silly things like raise 7 to the 99th power (4.6206807e+83): 

```
>> 7 ** 99
Integer(MInteger { value: 462068072803536855906378252728602401551029028414946485847699333055955922805275437143 })
```

# Executables 

There are two executables generated by building Micron. There is the REPL **micron-repl** and **micron** which will read in a file and execute it. 

# Syntax

For information regarding the syntax of Micron, checkout the Syntax.md file. I'm doing my best to make sure that all of the syntax that is created throughout the development process gets added.

# WIP

This is a work in progress. Right now there isn't a whole lot that can be done, but its a lot of fun to play with. Once I get a solid amount of functionality down I will do a full write up of what can be done.
