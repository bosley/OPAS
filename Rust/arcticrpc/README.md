### RPC library for rust

This is a simple RPC library written in rust. I don't expect it to be used for anything important as it was a project I took on in-part to help me learn rust. I've tested it, and it works well enough for basic purposes. 

I doubt anyone cares, but I'm leaving it marked as 'WIP' as I may end up changing it wildly as I adopt it into future projects. 

### Examples

For examples, check the examples directory. It is _very_ simple to use. 


### Documentation

I've added all the documentation you could need to get up and running. I despise sparse documentation in projects, so I made sure that I gave the information needed to get going. If you think the docs could use updating, please feel free to do so.
