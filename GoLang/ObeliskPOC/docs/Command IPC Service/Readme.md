# Command IPC Service (CIPCS)

JsonRPC Port : ***18200***

The command inter-process communication service enables a use to interact with an Obelisk running on a local machine. Currently, the CIPCS can only shutdown the local Obelisk. As more commands are created, they will be added here.

CIPCS is available via JsonRPC
