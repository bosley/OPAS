# CruxBus 

This is a go at a message passing system. Its pretty simple. It abstracts some things away so it might be useful. Could be used to pass data between threads, and if implemented correctly (see usage of TSGP) over the network to a specific task. 

Right now its an infant, but the plan is to develop it in my spare time to help with other projects that I plan on doing in the future. 

This thing uses c++11, and I'm wanting to make it independant of any third-party libraries but we'll see how that works out once the networking side of things comes around. Oh yeah, I guess the en/decrypt stuff might use a third party. Who knows. More to come in the future, but idk how soon. 


For examples see **examples**.
