# Obelus   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joshbosley/Obelus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joshbosley/Obelus)

The Obelus code base is under development! Nothing here is solid yet, so I wouldn't recommend anyone use it for anything.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to explore the use of lua within c++ and create an easy to setup and customize TCP server.
