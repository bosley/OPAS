# What it is

A place to put c++ networking helpers.

# Why is it

On private projects I've been making use-specific networking stuff or relying on QT / Boost.

# What will it become

Honestly, if it doesn't get used much it will be stuffed into the OPAS repo under C++
If it does, I'd like to add TCP/UDP stuff for windows and linux.
