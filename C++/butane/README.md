Utility libraries for C++

While writing [Obelus](https://github.com/joshbosley/Obelus) to explore the creation and use of different libraries, I decided to start
_butane_ to place general-purpose easy to use utilities as things made within [Obelus](https://github.com/joshbosley/Obelus) tend to form
around their specific use-case within [Obelus](https://github.com/joshbosley/Obelus).
