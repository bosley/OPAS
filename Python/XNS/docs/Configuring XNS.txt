Running XNS:

    0. Determine which network adapter you're using
    1. Run ./configure source config
    2. Ensure each node in network has a unique id in their repsective xnscommon/node_settings.json

Removing device files in xnsexternal (This removes ALL devices in xnsexternal):

    0. Run ./configure clean devices     

Adding device interaction:

    0. Go to xnsexternal/skel and create a skeleton file

    Example : 
                name:motion_sensor
                routine:check_motion
                #
                name:temp_sensor
                routine:check_for_overheat
                slot:get_temp
                stream:F,C,K
                #
                name:light_switch
                slot:turn_on
                slot:turn_off
                slot:toggle

    2. run ./configure gen devices

    All devices in skeleton file will be created. All previously existing
    files will be ignored, and device_settings.json overwritten.
    That said, this should not be done except for when laying the groundwork
    for a new setup as settings file may be inaccurate for skipped files!

Merging device files in xnsexternal into XNS :

    0. Run ./configure source devices
