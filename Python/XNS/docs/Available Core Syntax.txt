XNS Path Example:

    <node id>.<device>.<routine | slot>.<data stream>

    Sometimes written as (uid.dev.sor.ds)


Commands are to be seperated by a "." and no spaces. 


Command Line : 

    Enter a series of valid instructions, and then to execute, use ' commit. '


Printing :

    print.pool              =>  Core signal pool
    print.tickets           =>  Core pending tickets
    print.retinfo           =>  Information retrieved from another device 
    print.self              =>  Device Settings
    print.<node_name>       =>  Node ID
    print.address           =>  Node Ip address
    print.nodes             =>  Displays info dump on all known remote nodes
    print.comptick          =>  How many requests completed
    print.sd                =>  Print all data vars set
    print.sp                =>  Print all path vars set


Requests:

    req.<node id>.<device>.<routine | slot>.<data stream>

    Example :
        (Routine) - Check if motion is happeneing (data stream is ignored in routines)
        req.0001.motion_sensor.check_motion._UNSET_

        (Slot)  - Get temperature in fahrenheit 
        req.0001.temp_sensor.get_temp.F

    While in CLI mode, status can be checked by printing retinfo or tickets

    Note : Tickets can are uo


Assignment of Variables:

    
    Example assignment:

        'SP' variable should only be assigned to XNS paths (uid.dev.sor.ds)
            - Set Path

        sp.the_var.uid.dev.sor.ds      (ds optional)

        'SD' variable can contain anything other than $ (Yes, '.' can be used, but '. .'+ will become '.' ) 
            - Set Data

        sd.the_var."This is some data"



Loop

    loop.<from>.<to>.<step>.<action>

If statement (Caused by req reply parameters)

if.sp.gt.sd.<sp action>
if.sp.lt.sd.<sp action>
if.sp.eq.sd.<sp action>
if.sp.gte.sd.<sp action>
if.sp.lte.sd.<sp action>
