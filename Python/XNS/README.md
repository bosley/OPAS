# XNS
Networked hardware/ software controller for remote monitoring and control.

XNS stands for "Cross-Network Skeleton"
This project was made so that I could do some home automation, but it has grown beyond that in its scope.
XNS is now technically "Cross-Networks" with the addition of beacons, but that functionality is not wholly 
implemented as of yet. Help would be appreciated, and can be found in TODO.md. 
I originally created this with the intent of it being a private project so things may seem hard to 
understand until I lay everything out in the wiki, and make a developer section that lays out the 
program structure. 
 
For information regarding usage, please see wiki/home.md
