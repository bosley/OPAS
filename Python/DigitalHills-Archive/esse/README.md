## What is Esse ?

Esse is a project under development created with the purpose of implementing a Python3 based 
distributed ledger. The Esse project isn't making any promises of a revolutionary block chain
implementation, the Esse project exists for the exploration of block chain development and
the accompanying challenges. 

## What make Esse special ?

The Esse project isn't special. Its final form's usefulness may be far from the current 
distributed ledgers in existence. What may seperate Esse from other distributed ledgers in a 
positive manner is that it isn't a simple BTC clone. 

## How can you use Esse ?

Right now, you can't. Its not even in an alpha release. Its missing so much functionality that
it in-reality is just a lump of files that can run without error in the Python3 interpreter.
