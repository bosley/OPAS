    Create a pillar (example in main.py)
        If exists other pillars, inject one other pillar's info into database (example in main.py)

    Launch pillar (example in main.py)
        If another pillar is in the database, it will contact and sync. Once sync is 
        complete, it can serve requests.

        If no other pillar is in the database, then it starts serving requests.

    Create a node (example in main.py)
        Manually add a single pillar (example in main.py)
            - Once connected all pillars and nodes will sync with node
